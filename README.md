# Genomics_finalProject
A repository for the codes created as a part of the final project of the course Analysis and visualization of genomic data from the Master in Computational Biology of the UPM

The project is divided in 7 parts:
1. Metagenomics
2. Genomics
3. Reads mapping
4. Variant calling
5. Differential Expression Analysis (complementary DESeq2.R script)
6. Functional prediction
7. Phylogenetic analysis (complementary print_trees.py script)

For each part there is be a jupyter notebook in Bash langiage containing the code and extended answer to all the questions in the questionnaire. There are also supplementary scripts used for parts 5 (R) and 7 (Python), and 'png' files with the images that the notebooks display.
