# Genomics_finalProject
A repository for the codes created as a part of the final project of the course Analysis and visualization of genomic data from the Master in Computational Biology of the UPM

The project is divided in 7 parts:
1. Metagenomics
2. Genomics
3. Reads mapping
4. Variant calling
5. Differential Expression Analysis
6. Functional prediction
7. Phylogenetic analysis: this part will have two notebooks

For each part there will be a jupyter notebook containing the code and extended answer to all the questions in the questionnaire. The notebooks are all in bash language with one exception: the second part of the phylogenetic analysis, which had to be programmed in Python and therefore has a separate notebook.
