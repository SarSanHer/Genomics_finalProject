    "- NP_Unk01: we find two main protein functions: nitrogenase iron protein NifH, an ATP and iron dependent protein for nitrogen fixation; and AAA family ATPase, a  protein family  that catalyzes reactions to obtain energy from ATP [3]. _Aquifex aeolicus_ is not a nitrogen fixating organism, but other strains are, and given that the variant with best quality is a NifA, this sequence is probably a nitrogen fixating protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "- NP_Unk02: Ïƒ54 dependent Fis family transcriptional regulator, an ATP-dependent  transcriptional factor (TF). Given that there are no annotations about this TF in uniprot (all entries are for predicted proteins), we can try to get more information by looking into other not so close homologues. We see that the sequence is also associated with the nif-specific transcriptional activator NifA, so maybe this TF is an activator of the NifH that NP_Unk01 was associated to.\n",

Nitrogen is a limiting nutrient, and with the high abundance of _Aquifex_ plus the overexpression of nitrogen fixating genes, there would be a significant raise in the nitrogen fixation rate. Consequently, after the high-temperature event, the environment would have a higher concentration of nitrogen that would not limit (as it usually does) the growth of algae, letting the algae bloom take place."
